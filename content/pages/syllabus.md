Course Overview
---------------

This course is meant to bring graduate students who will be using ideas from differential topology and differential geometry up to speed on these topics. Below is list of some of the highlights of the first semester.

1.  Banach Manifolds and the inverse and implicit function theorems.  
      
    
2.  Sard's theorem (for smooth maps). Parametric transversality and some applications.  
      
    
3.  Whitney's embedding theorems both easy and hard.  
      
    
4.  Pontryagin-Thom construction. Fruedenthal suspension theorem. Computation of the low dimensional stable homotopy groups of spheres.  
      
    
5.  Morse theory.  
      
    
6.  Differential forms. de Rham's theorem.  
      
    
7.  Smales immersion theorem.
